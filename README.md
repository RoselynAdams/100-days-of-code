# 100-days-of-code
### Day 1
**Today’s progress:** Today I worked through two Cody Academy lessons on HTML. 
 
**Thoughts:** I'm starting slow and steady and hoping that this whole coding thing starts to come back to me. I think the Code Academy lessons will be a nice refresher before I start diving into more complicated things.

### Day 2
**Today’s progress:** Today I worked through another Code Academy lesson today. I learned about ordered lists, unordered lists, adding photos, videos and links
 
**Thoughts:** Things are started to come back to me! Woot! I'm looking forward to getting through these basics so I can get to the fun part -- design. 

### Day 3
**Today’s progress:** Today I worked through some navigation stuff. 
 
**Thoughts:** Today was spent traveling from Iowa, so I didn't get through as much code as the previous two days. 

### Day 8
**Today’s progress:** I started working towards a front end development certification through Free Code Camp. 
 
**Thoughts:** I've been incapacited for a few days due to oral surgery (ick), so I'm trying to rededicate myself to the 100 day challenge. I think getting into a routine and working towards the certification will be a big help. Free Code Camp also works at a faster pace, so I'm not getting bored. The information is also presented in a way in which I can easily see how it is applicable to building a webpage. Today I worked through 31 challenges on the path toward front end development certification. Hoozah! 

### Day 9
**Today’s progress:** Day's lessons were all about styling, including text, color, margin, padding and border. 

**Thoughts:** Today's lessons were a little bit dense. Although this is the fun part for me, the design of a webage, I'm chomping at the bit to get into more independ work. I think I might skip ahead a bit and start on the first project for Free Code Camp, which is to create a tribute page.  

### Day 10
**Today’s progress:** Today I learned a bit about the heirarchy of styles, ie, classes, ids, inlines styles and !important!

**Thoughts:** Today I learned about how different classes and ids override one another. It was helpful to learn how each is read. I can also see this coming in handy when I'm coding and don't know why something looks the way it does or when I want to override a style from a CSS library. 


### Day 12
**Today’s progress:** I started to work on responsive desing today. Trucking right along!

**Thoughts:** I started the resposive design with boostrap section of Free Code Camp today. I centered text, made images mobile-responsive, added buttons and styled them for days. I'm definitely starting to feel more confident with writing code from scratch when prompted. Baby steps!

### Day ??
**Thoughts:** Hello again, code! I've decided to get back on the horse! I know I definitely failed at the the 100 days of code, but I still want to be coding and learning more. So, I'm going to try not to feel discouraged and contintue working my way through freecodecamp. I'm not ready to commit to 100 days, but I think a few days a week is a good goal for me.
