# 100-days-of-code
### Day 1
**Today’s progress:** Today I worked through two Cody Academy lessons on HTML. 
 
**Thoughts:** I'm starting slow and steady and hoping that this whole coding thing starts to come back to me. I think the Code Academy lessons will be a nice refresher before I start diving into more complicated things.

### Day 2
**Today’s progress:** Today I worked through another Code Academy lesson today. I learned about ordered lists, unordered lists, adding photos, videos and links
 
**Thoughts:** Things are started to come back to me! Woot! I'm looking forward to getting through these basics so I can get to the fun part -- design. 

### Day 3
**Today’s progress:** Today I worked through some navigation stuff. 
 
**Thoughts:** Today was spent traveling from Iowa, so I didn't get through as much code as the previous two days. 

### Day 8
**Today’s progress:** I started working towards a front end development certification through Free Code Camp. 
 
**Thoughts:** I've been incapacited for a few days due to oral surgery (ick), so I'm trying to rededicate myself to the 100 day challenge. I think getting into a routine and working towards the certification will be a big help. Free Code Camp also works at a faster pace, so I'm not getting bored. The information is also presented in a way in which I can easily see how it is applicable to building a webpage. Today I worked through 31 challenges on the path toward front end development certification. Hoozah! 

### Day 9
**Today’s progress:** Day's lessons were all about styling, including text, color, margin, padding and border. 

**Thoughts:** Today's lessons were a little bit dense. Although this is the fun part for me, the design of a webage, I'm chomping at the bit to get into more independ work. I think I might skip ahead a bit and start on the first project for Free Code Camp, which is to create a tribute page.  

### Day 10
**Today’s progress:** Today I learned a bit about the heirarchy of styles, ie, classes, ids, inlines styles and !important!

**Thoughts:** Today I learned about how different classes and ids override one another. It was helpful to learn how each is read. I can also see this coming in handy when I'm coding and don't know why something looks the way it does or when I want to override a style from a CSS library.
