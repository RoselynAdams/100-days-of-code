# 100-days-of-code
### Day 1
**Today’s progress:** Today I worked through two Cody Academy lessons on HTML. 
 
**Thoughts:** I'm starting slow and steady and hoping that this whole coding thing starts to come back to me. I think the Code Academy lessons will be a nice refresher before I start diving into more complicated things.

### Day 2
**Today’s progress:** Today I worked through another Code Academy lesson today. I learned about ordered lists, unordered lists, adding photos, videos and links
 
**Thoughts:** IThings are started to come back to me! Woot! I'm looking forward to getting through these basics so I can get to the fun part -- design.
